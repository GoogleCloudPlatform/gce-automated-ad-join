# Automatically joining VMs to Active Directory

This repository contains the code of the `register-computer` Cloud Run app. This app enables you
to automatically join VM instances to an Active Directory domain. For more information,
see [Configuring Active Directory for VMs to automatically join a domain](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/configuring-active-directory-for-vms-to-automatically-join-the-domain).

The code is organized as follows:

* `register-computer/main.py` contains the entry point of the Cloud Run app and implements the
   logic for both, joining computers to a domain and scavenging stale computer accounts.
* `register-computer/join.ps1` is the PowerShells script that is deliverered to be run by a
   joining computer while executing the _sysprep specialize_ phase.
* `register-computer/ad/` contains code to connect, search, and create computer accounts in
   Active Directory.
* `register-computer/gcp/` contains code to interact with the Compute Engine API.
* `register-computer/kerberos/` contains code to reset computer account passwords by using a
   helper tool, `ksetpwd`.
* `ksetpwd/` contains the code of a helper tool which uses [MIT Kerberos](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/)
  to reset account passwords in Active Directory.

## Configuration

The `register-computer` app obtains its configuration from the environment and supports the following environment variables:

* `AD_DOMAIN` (required): DNS domain used by Active Directory
* `AD_DOMAINCONTROLLER` (optional): Name or IP of domain controller to use. If not specified, the app will locate a domain controller via DNS automatically. This variable should only be used for testing.
* `AD_USERNAME` (required): Username of Active Directory service user. The user must have permission to manage computer objects in the OUs used for automatic domain joining. The value must be provided in `NETBIOS-DOMAIN\SAM-ACCOUNT-NAME` format, UPNs are not supported.
* `AD_PASSWORD` (optional): Clear-text password of Active Directory service user.  This variable should only be used for testing.
* `SM_PROJECT_ADPASSWORD` (or `SECRET_PROJECT_ID` for backward compatibility) (required unless `AD_PASSWORD` is used): Project ID under which the AD credentials have been stored in Secret Manager.
* `SM_NAME_ADPASSSWORD` (or `SECRET_NAME` for backward compatibility) (required unless `AD_PASSWORD` is used): Name of the secret under which the AD credentials have been stored in Secret Manager.
* `SM_VERSION_ADPASSWORD` (or `SECRET_VERSION` for backward compatibility) (required unless `AD_PASSWORD` is used): Version of the secret under which the AD credentials have been stored in Secret Manager. Can be set to `latest`.
* `SM_PROJECT_CACERT` (optional if a public Certificate Authority is used): Project ID under which the certificate trust chain for the Certification Authority has been stored in Secret Manager.
* `SM_NAME_CACERT` (optional see `SM_PROJECT_CACERT`): Name of the secret which holds the certificate trust chain for the Certification Authority in Secret Manager.
* `SM_VERSION_CACERT` (optional see `SM_PROJECT_CACERT`): Version of the secret which holds the certificate trust chain for the Certification Authority in Secret Manager. Can be set to `latest`.
* `FUNCTION_IDENTITY`: (required) Email address of the app's service account.
* `LOGGING_LEVEL` (optional): Logging level for log messages. See [Logging Levels](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#levels) for acceptable values. The default logging level is set to INFO.

If you run the app locally, you will need to pass the following, additional environment variables to simulate a
Cloud Run environment:

* `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` (required for testing): Path to a service account key of a service account that permits the app to interact with Compute Engine. 

## Deciding on the OU structure for joined computers

Set one of the following environment variables (if both or none are set, the app will fail):

* `PROJECTS_DN`: Distinguished name of the OU containing the individual project OUs.
The app places computer accounts into the organizational unit `CN=<project_id>,<PROJECTS_DN>`.
The app does not create the OU. Make sure you create the OU for the target project, before joining its instances.
VM instances whose project does not have an OU `CN=<project_id>,<PROJECTS_DN>` will not be joined to Active Directory.

* `CUSTOM_OU_ROOT_DN`: Distinguished name of an OU that serves as root OU.
The app places computer accounts into organizational units that are descendants of the `<CUSTOM_OU_ROOT_DN>` OU.
Each joined VM instance must add a metadata key `target_ou` (case insensitive) and set it to
an OU (fully qualified) that is a descendant of the `<CUSTOM_OU_ROOT_DN>` OU.
VM instances that lack a `target_ou` metadata key will not be joined to Active Directory.

   The OU cannot be updated once a VM instance has been joined to Active Directory. If you specified the wrong `target_ou` value, do the following:
   * Manually move the computer object to the new OU. 
   * Optionally, update the VM metadata for future reference. The metadata will not be inspected after the computer has already been created.
   * If necessary, move the computer group to the new OU. 
   * If you created a managed instance group (MIG) with the wrong `target_ou` value, create a new instance template, update the MIG, and then manually delete the old group in AD.  

## Testing locally

### Launching the app

You can run `main.py` locally for testing and debugging purposes:

* Create a new Python virtual environment and activate it.
* Install requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* Configure environment variables.
* Run `main.py`. The app will listen on port 5000 by default.

### Invoking the app

To invoke the app, you need a valid ID Token. To obtain one, launch VM instance and run the following command:

`curl -H "Metadata-Flavor: Google" 'http://metadata/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/identity?audience=https://127.0.0.1:5000/&format=full'`

Given an ID Token, you can send a request to the app:

`curl -H "Authorization: Bearer [ID Token]" -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
